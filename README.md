# Plant-Watering-Tracker

This program allows users to create a database with all their houseplants, including information like each plants name, location, and information about it's watering schedule. It then creates Google Calendar events to remind you when each plant needs to be watered. You can also reaccess your list of plants to view all, update both the database and calendar events, and delete.

Never forget to water your plant again!
